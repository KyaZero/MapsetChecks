                    Since gameplay is based on audio cues it wouldn't make much sense to have certain hit windows happen earlier or later, 
                    even if only by a few ms.
                    <br \><br \>
                    The only reason a 1 ms leniency exists is because the editor casts decimal times to integers rather than rounds them 
                    properly, which causes these 1 ms unsnaps occasionally when copying and pasting hit objects and timing lines. This bug 
                    happens so frequently that basically all ranked maps have multiple 1 ms unsnaps in them.

                        ratio of 300s to 100s by 1.6%. This is acceptable, and a much larger variable is introduced by the possibility of
