                    Newer players need time to recognize that they should begin spinning, as well as time to regain control of their 
                    cursor after spinning. Hence, too short spinners will often lose them accuracy or combo, and objects very close 
                    to the end of spinners will probably be missed or clicked on in panic before the spinner has ended."
