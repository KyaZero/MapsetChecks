                    Newer players often have trouble reading how far apart objects are in time, which is why enabling 
                    distance spacing for lower difficulties is often recommended. However, if two spacings for different 
                    snappings look similar, it's possible to confuse them. By forcing an overlap between objects close in 
                    time and discouraging it for objects further apart, the difference in snappings become more apparent."
