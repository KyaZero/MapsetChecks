                        mean going through the same slider path twice for the right and top parts.

                    Largely follows the same reasoning as the overlapping slider tail/head/anchor check; if the player 
                    needs to rely on guessing, and guessing wrong results in a slider break, then that's an unfair 
                    gameplay experience.
                    <br \><br \>
                    A single path going back on itself far enough for the follow circle to not cover everything, is 
                    neither lenient nor something players will expect considering that sliders are expected to have 
                    a clear path. When the follow circle does cover the whole path, however, it's generally acceptable 
                    since even if the player misreads it, it usually doesn't cause any slider breaks.
                    <br \><br \>
                    Should a slider go back on itself and end before it creates its own borders, players without slider 
                    tails enabled will have a hard time seeing how far back into itself it goes, or even if it goes 
                    back on itself at all.

                        A slider which goes back on itself multiple times and is impossible to read for players with 
                        slider tails hidden, which is common in skinning.
